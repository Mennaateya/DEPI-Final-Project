# Project Reorganization Summary

## Overview

The Medical AI Diagnostics System (DEPI) has been successfully reorganized into a cleaner, more maintainable structure. This document summarizes the changes made and provides guidance for working with the new structure.

## Directory Structure

The project now follows a standard structure with clear separation of concerns:

```
/
├── client/             # React frontend
├── server/             # FastAPI backend
├── models/             # Model files
│   ├── bone_fracture/
│   ├── monkeypox/
│   ├── skin_cancer/
│   ├── tumor/
│   ├── xray/
│   ├── palm_disease/
│   └── lung_colon/
├── docker/             # Docker configuration
└── docker-compose.yml  # Docker Compose configuration
```

## Changes Made

1. **Frontend Reorganization**:
   - Moved React application from `react-app/` to `client/`
   - Preserved all components, assets, and configuration

2. **Backend Reorganization**:
   - Moved FastAPI application from `api/` to `server/`
   - Preserved API endpoints, models, schemas, and utilities
   - Updated import paths where necessary

3. **Model Management**:
   - Created dedicated `models/` directory with subdirectories for each model type
   - Added placeholder files for missing models
   - Created a README.md with instructions for model management

4. **Docker Configuration**:
   - Updated docker-compose.yml to reflect the new directory structure
   - Added health checks and environment variables
   - Created a new docker-compose.new.yml file (use this for deployment)

## Working with the New Structure

### Running the Application

To run the application with Docker:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.new.yml up
```

### Model Loading

Models are now loaded from the `/models` directory. The model loader has been updated to use the new paths. See `MODEL_LOADING_GUIDE.md` for detailed information on model loading.

### Development Workflow

1. **Frontend Development**:
   - Navigate to the `client/` directory
   - Run `npm install` to install dependencies
   - Run `npm start` to start the development server

2. **Backend Development**:
   - Navigate to the `server/` directory
   - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies
   - Run `uvicorn main:app --reload` to start the development server

## Next Steps

1. Review the reorganized structure and ensure all components are working correctly
2. Update any hardcoded paths in the code to reflect the new structure
3. Test the application thoroughly to ensure all functionality works as expected
4. Use docker-compose.new.yml for deployment
5. Download or add the actual model files to the models directory if they're missing

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues after the reorganization:

1. Check the logs for error messages
2. Verify that all paths in the code have been updated to reflect the new structure
3. Ensure that all model files are in the correct locations
4. Check that all dependencies are installed correctly

## Conclusion

The reorganization has created a more maintainable and scalable project structure. The separation of frontend, backend, and model files makes it easier to develop, test, and deploy the application.
